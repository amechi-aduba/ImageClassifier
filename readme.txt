/**********************************************************************
 * Some people (especially in Europe and Latin America) write a 7     *
 * with a line through the middle, while others (especially in Japan  *
 * and Korea) make the top line crooked.                              *
 *                                                                    *
 * Suppose that the training data consists solely of samples that do  *
 * not use any of these conventions. How well do you think the        *
 * algorithm will perform when you test it on different populations?  *
 * What are the possible consequences?                                *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: This algorithm will perform significantly poorly when being used
on different fonts of writing numbers, it could get that 7 with a dash through
it confused with a 1 potentially.

/**********************************************************************
 * Now suppose that you are using a supervised learning algorithm to  *
 * diagnose cancer. Suppose the training data consists of examples    *
 * solely on individuals from population X but you use it on          *
 * individuals from population Y. What are the possible consequences? *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: If I use the cure based off data from one population to another,
most likely there wouldn't be as good of a success rate when compared to
the population X because we never tested population Y's data and whether they're
genetically compatible with the cure.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past students, or
 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"
 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?
Yes I went to TA hours on Monday.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?
No




/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here. It was hard for me to understand exactly
 what I needed to do in the code, I had a competely different idea as to
 what I was supposed to do. However, the TA helped me understand, but it would
 help if there was a bit more clarification on the steps I need to make to
 create the code.
